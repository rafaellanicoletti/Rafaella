            <p>We basically started everything from a high fidelity standpoint. We had a set Design system that made this easier for later improvements or changes. It might not be the usual way of approaching UX and UI work but it certainly helped with communicating design decisions better with the stakeholders and also provided a clear roadmap for content.

            <p>All screens were clickable and had an appropriate flow. For more complex screens we designed specific interaction so we could show Developers making it easier for the developing process as well as showing stakeholders.

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p> From a visual design perspective, majority of assets were already created for desktop which had to be transformed into responsive. With this, typography hierarchy definitely changed and some images that did not fit the common phone screen. In order to get the perfect mix of visual design between desktop and mobile without having everything to be different we focused a lot in the usability of different component and sometimes components created exclusively for mobile screens were later translated into the desktop experience.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2> 
            <p>  Accessibility is tricky but at Foxgroove is something we always had in mind, and I did since working at Freedom Mortgage. I always go by ADA and WGAC standards. For example at Foxgroove we had compatible typography for disabilities and we always thought about the user and how it would interact with the website. We had an online quiz to design (in both desktop and mobile) and sometimes it would be too many answers that if we did not add the step the user was in, we could create fatigue and make the user quit the quiz without getting the expected result.

          <h2>Agile Environment</h2>  
            <p>Starting the week as the UX team we would hold short (or long) meetings to see where everyone was up to and there were any changes that needed attention. We were organized in short sprint plans (1 month) and would usually updated them on Airtable, therefore, we knew where Dev work was at the time, Content and Designs (these were also separated into responsive and desktop experiences). 
                When we saw significant changes, design meetings were required where everyone collaborated on the Figma file to double check the requirements, our design standards and sometimes to bounce off any new ideas on how to handle the new changes.

          <h2>Tools & Design System</h2>  
            <p>Primarily for designing we used Figma, for the design system and even for Icon design. As a team we usually worked off from 1 big file divided into pages that were specifically for Desktop or responsive screen. The latest Figma update with Sections made it easier for us to locate the screens in a file that had more than 80+ screens. 
            </p>
             <p>We developed a comprehensive design system that seamlessly integrated desktop and mobile environments. Our design system was meticulously documented and included details such as button shapes, sizes, and special rules that applied to both desktop and responsive. By having such a robust design system, we were able to work more efficiently and consistently maintain patterns across all platforms.
                Furthermore, we understood the importance of brand consistency and created a brand guide specifically for the marketing team of our client. This allowed us to better serve all departments of the organization and ensure that the design language remained cohesive and on-brand. Overall, our attention to detail and dedication to creating design systems that prioritize efficiency and consistency allowed us to deliver exceptional results for our clients.
